# Diabetes Data Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of a single patient, and an analysis of over 70 patients with diabetes. For the latter group, a model is included that can be used to predict a sample blood sugar at any given time of the day.

## Overview
1. `analysis.ipynb` - contains an analysis of patient 0
2. `model.ipynb`- contains an analysis of all 70 patients, as well as a random forest prediction model

## Inspiration
In June of 2022, I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes, and in September of that year Type I diabetes. I would love to replace patient 0 with my own readings if I ever aquire a continous BG monitor.
